		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			Shadow Spear Initiative (SHDWSPR) was founded in 2954. Born from a vision of independence and
			adaptability, SHDWSPR operates in the vast expanse of the 'verse, offering its members freedom
			to pursue their own goals while maintaining the support of a dedicated and skilled
			organization.
		</p>
		<p>
			SHDWSPR engages in a range of activities, including (but not limited to) freelance contracts,
			mercenary work, bounty hunting, trading, resource gathering, and hauling.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite its mercenary roots, SHDWSPR is not bound by a strict military hierarchy. Instead, it
			thrives on a brotherhood of capable pilots, soldiers, and industrialists who work together for
			mutual success.

		<h2>Manifesto</h2>
		<p>
			In the vast and chaotic expanse of the 'verse, where empires rise and fall, where corporations
			exploit and syndicates manipulate, we stand apart. Shadow Spear Initiative is not bound by
			bureaucracy, not shackled by politics, and not driven by blind allegiance. We are freelancers,
			warriors, and survivors; a force navigating the stars on our own terms.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do not seek conquest, nor do we kneel to those who claim dominion over the void. Instead,
			we forge our own path, taking contracts that suit our interests, forging alliances where they
			benefit us, and protecting what is ours with unwavering resolve.

		<h3 class="glow-title">Our Principles</h3>
		<section class="principle">
			<h4>Freedom Above All</h4>
			<p>
				We answer to no king, no empire, no corporation. We operate where we will, take the jobs we
				choose, and determine our own destiny. Our members have autonomy in how they operate, but
				they are expected to uphold the Initiative's honor and interests.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="principle">
			<h4>Honor in Action</h4>
			<p>
				We are not pirates. We are not griefers. Our actions define us, and we conduct our business
				with integrity. Betrayal, senseless destruction, and chaos have no place among us. We fight,
				we protect, we profitâ€”but we do not dishonor our name.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="principle">
			<h4>Strength Through Unity</h4>
			<p>
				A lone mercenary is a gun for hire. A team of mercenaries is a force to be reckoned with. We
				stand together, covering each other's backs, ensuring that no member is left behind. Whether
				in battle, trade, or exploration, we are stronger as a unit.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="principle">
			<h4>Adapt and Overcome</h4>
			<p>
				The 'verse is unpredictable, and survival belongs to those who can adapt. Whether in battle
				or business, we are always ready to pivot, seize opportunities, and overcome challenges.
				Strategy, cunning, and resilience are our weapons as much as our firearms.
			</p>

			<li>
				<strong>Freelance Contracting:</strong> <div>We take on contracts that align with our interests, whether

	<section class="section-header">
		<h3 class="glow-title">The Shadow Spear Ethos</h3>
		<p>
			We are shadows in the dark, spears in the hands of those who dare to fight. We operate in the
			liminal space between law and lawlessness, taking what we need, defending what is ours, and
			ensuring that those who stand against us regret the day they did.
		</p>
		<p>Those who stand with us will find opportunity. Those who betray us will find only regret.</p>
		<p class="glow-text">We are Shadow Spear Initiative. The 'verse will remember our name.</p>

		<h2>Charter</h2>
		<p>
			By the Will of those who stand in the shadows and strike with precision, the Shadow Spear
			Initiative is established as an independent and self-sustaining force, bound by profit,
			survival, and tactical superiority.
		</p>
		<p>
			SHDWSPR operates beyond borders, beyond politics, and owes allegiance only to its own code.
			While we respect the laws of the UEE where beneficial, we do not bow to any empire, faction,
			or authority that would seek to limit our freedom or potential.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is decreed that SHDWSPR shall remain neutral, but never passive and shall engage in battle,
			trade, or diplomacy as needed to secure its interests. Our path is not one of conquest, but of
			calculated force, ensuring that our members thrive in the void, adapt to any challenge, and
			execute with precision.
		</p>
		<p>
			To this end, Spear Tactical, Spear Logistics, Spear Recon, and Spear Guardian are instituted
			to uphold our mission and safeguard the future of the Initiative.
